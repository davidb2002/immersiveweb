immersiveweb
============

A website framework to provide a 3D immersive and interactive web experience using the latest web technology without the need for plugins or additional software.

CODERS/VISIONARIES WANTED

This project needs coders and visionaries who are passionate about 3d web and building a 3d web platform. If you are, please get involved! With your help we can change the web as we know it.

THE VISION

immersiveweb is based off the vision that the future of the internet is 3D. Webpages and sites as we know it will no longer exist and will be replaced by 3D web environments which provide exactly the same features and abilities available today on sites, but in a 3d format. VRML was an early attempt which failed due to the requirement of software plugins. However, with the support for WebGL (and similar) in the latest web browsers, this is now possible without plugins. A platform that any developer can use easily to create a 3d environment that immitates their existing website without the need of plugins or additional software.
